**Type**: organize_files
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Created**: 2026-02-17T10:05:00
**Status**: PENDING

## Context
Organize files in the project directory by moving documentation files to a docs/ folder and configuration files to a config/ folder. This will improve project structure and make files easier to find.

Files to organize:
- README.md → docs/
- CONSTITUTIONAL_VALIDATION.md → docs/
- GRADUATION_CHECKLIST.md → docs/
- .env.example → config/

## Expected Output
List of files moved with their new locations. Confirmation that directory structure is updated.
