### Step 3: Structure the Post

- Provide value, insight, or story
- Support your hook with details

**Call-to-Action** (1 sentence):
- Clear, specific action

### Step 4: Add Hashtags
Select 3-5 hashtags that are:
- Relevant to the content
- Popular in your industry
- Mix of broad and niche tags
- Not overly promotional

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Length

- Maximum: 3000 characters (LinkedIn limit)

### Tone Options
**Professional**: Industry insights, data-driven, authoritative
- Use: statistics, research, expert opinions

- Clickbait: "You won't believe...", "This one trick..."
- Hard selling: "Buy now!", "Limited time offer!"
- Controversial topics: politics, religion, divisive issues
- Unverified claims or guarantees

## Approval Process

ALL LinkedIn posts require approval because:
- Public visibility impacts brand reputation
- Content represents company voice
- Mistakes are difficult to undo
- Legal and compliance considerations

For each post:
1. Generate content and validate
2. Create draft file in Pending_Approval/
3. Create approval request with preview
4. Wait for human decision (poll every 60 seconds)
5. If approved: publish via MCP
6. If rejected: log reason and archive
7. If timeout: auto-reject after 24 hours

## Publishing via MCP

To publish a post:

```python
from scripts.mcp_client import get_mcp_client

mcp_client = get_mcp_client()

result = mcp_client.create_linkedin_post(
    content=post_content,
    hashtags=["AI", "Automation", "Business"],
    visibility="public"
)

# Result contains:
# - status: "published" or error
# - post_id: LinkedIn post identifier
# - created_at: timestamp
```

## Response Format

Always respond with:

```json
{
  "content_generation": {
    "topic": "AI automation benefits for small businesses",
    "tone": "professional",
    "hook": "Did you know that 67% of small businesses...",
    "body": "Full post body text",
    "cta": "What's your experience with automation?",
    "hashtags": ["AI", "SmallBusiness", "Automation"],
    "character_count": 287,
    "validation": {
      "valid": true,
      "warnings": [],

    }
  },

  }
}
```
